# 🧠 LinkedIn Profile Photo Generator

This project focuses on converting casual user images into professional-looking profile pictures suitable for LinkedIn. Using the **OstrisAI Toolkit**, we enhanced visual quality while preserving the individual’s identity. A key part of our workflow involved captioning images using **Florence-2** to extract meaningful descriptions. These captions were used to guide **Stable Diffusion** —a powerful image generation model—to enhance pose, background, lighting, and attire. Additionally, we applied **LoRA fine-tuning** to personalize outputs and maintain identity consistency. The project demonstrated the integration of vision-language models and generative AI for creating polished, career-ready profile images.
